************ USING COOKIES FOR SESSION MANAGEMENT ***********

1> Session Creation:

-- When a user logs into a web application, the server generates a 
   unique session identifier (session ID) for that user’s session.
-- The server stores relevant session data (user information, preferences,
   etc.) associated with the session ID on the server-side memory or in 
   a database.
-- The server sends the session ID to the client’s browser as a cookie 
   in the HTTP response header. The cookie is then stored on the client’s 
   machine.

2> Session Management:

-- With each subsequent request, the client’s browser automatically 
   includes the session ID cookie in the HTTP request header.
-- The server extracts the session ID from the request header, uses it 
   to retrieve the corresponding session data from its storage, and 
   processes the request in the context of that user’s session.
-- This allows the server to provide personalized content and maintain 
   user state across different requests.

3> Session Termination:

-- Sessions can be terminated by the user explicitly logging out or by 
   the server if the session becomes inactive for a specified period 
   (session timeout).
-- When a session is terminated, the server removes the associated session 
   data from its storage, and the session ID stored in the client’s cookie 
   becomes invalid.
