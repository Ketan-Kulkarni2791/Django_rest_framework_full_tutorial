*********** BASIC AUTHENTICATION ***********

-- This is a simple and straightforward method of authentication.
-- It involves sending the userâ€™s credentials (username and password) 
   with each request to the server.
-- The server then verifies these credentials before granting access to 
   the requested resource.
-- While Basic Authentication is easy to understand and implement, it 
   raises security concerns due to the transmission of credentials in 
   plain text.


*************** SESSION AUTHENTICATION **************

-- Session Authentication revolves around the concept of a user session, 
   where a user logs in once, and the server maintains their 
   authenticated state throughout their interaction with the application.
-- Instead of sending credentials with each request, the server assigns 
   a unique session identifier to the user after a successful login.
